#
# Types: KerberosPrinc, TLSCertSubject, MachineID
#
# Flags: GlobPattern, CaseInsensitive
# Filters are case-sensitive by default.

# Outputs
#

# For each output, you must configure a driver and a format.
# The format can be one of: "Raw", "RawJson", "Json", "Nxlog"
# The driver can be one of: "Files", "Kafka", "Tcp", "Redis", "UnixDatagram"

# Configure a Files output
# [[outputs]]
# driver = "Files"
# format = "Raw"

# Files driver has the following parameters:
# - path (required): the path in which files will be written. It can be parameterized
#       with variables using the syntax {variable} (see available variables in documentation)
# config = { path = "/var/log/openwec/{ip:2}/{ip:3}/{ip}/{principal}/messages" }


# Configure a Kafka output
# [[outputs]]
# driver = "Kafka"
# format = "Raw"

# Kafka driver has the following parameters:
# - topic (required): the Kafka topic to send events to
# - options (optional, defaults to undefined): additional kafka settings, directly
#      sent to librdkafka (https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/librdkafka/html/md_CONFIGURATION.html)
#      You should probably configure this in OpenWEC settings `outputs.kafka.options` if all your
#      outputs using the Kafka driver connect to the same Kafka cluster.
# config = { topic = "openwec", options = { "bootstrap.servers" = "localhost:9092" } }


# Configure a Tcp output
# [[outputs]]
# driver = "Tcp"
# format = "Raw"

# Tcp driver has the following parameters:
# - host (required): Hostname or IP Address to send events to
# - port (required): Tcp port to send events to
# - tls_enabled (optional, defaults to false): wrap the TCP stream in a TLS session.
#       Must be set for other tls_ options to take effect
# - tls_certificate_authorities (optional, defaults to undefined): Validate server certificate
#       chain against these authorities. You can define multiple files or paths.
#       All the certificates will be read and added to the trust store.
# - tls_certificate (optional, defaults to undefined): Path to certificate in PEM format.
#       This certificate will be presented to the server.
# - tls_key (optional, defaults to undefined): Path to the private key corresponding to the
#       specified certificate (PEM format).
# config = { host = "localhost", port = 5000 }


# Configure a Redis output
# [[outputs]]
# driver = "Redis"
# format = "Raw"

# Redis driver has the following parameters:
# - addr (required): Hostname or IP Address of the Redis server
# - list (required): Name of the Redis list to push events to
# config = { addr = "localhost", list = "openwec" }


# Configure a UnixDatagram output
# [[outputs]]
# driver = "UnixDatagram"
# format = "Raw"

# UnixDatagram driver has the following parameters:
# - path (required): Path of the Unix socket to send events to
# config = { path = "/tmp/openwec.socket" }
