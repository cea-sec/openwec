[server]
# [Optional]
# Set server logging verbosity
# This parameter is overwritten by --verbosity argument and
# the OPENWEC_LOG environment variable.
# Default value is warn
# verbosity = "warn"

# [Optional]
# Set subscriptions refresh interval
# Subscriptions are stored in the database. When you edit them using the cli,
# you only modify the database.
# The server retrieves its subscriptions from the database and cache
# them in memory. The in-memory subscriptions are refreshed at a fixed
# interval: `db_sync_interval`.
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# db_sync_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# Set heartbeat cache flush interval
# Heartbeat messages are cached in memory before being stored in database
# to improve performances.
# A flush operation saves all cached heartbeats in database at a fixed
# interval: `flush_heartbeats_interval`
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# flush_heartbeats_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# To "store" a heartbeat, request handlers send a message to a task responsible
# for managing heartbeats using a queue.
# The database store operation may take some time. During this operation, new heartbeats message
# are not popped from the queue, leading to the queue being full. When the queue is full,
# request handlers have to wait before sending a response to clients.
# You can customize the size of the queue, depending of the expected output of heartbeats
# messages to store and the duration of the database store operation.
# Default size of the queue is 2048.
# heartbeats_queue_size = 2048

# [Optional]
# Set node name
# This may be used by outputs. Unset by default.

##  Collectors settings  ##
###########################

# You may define multiple collect servers.
# Each collector must listen on a different (address, port) pair.
# All collectors share the same database.
# This is useful if you want to support both Kerberos and TLS authentication

# This defines one collector
[[collectors]]
# [Required]
# Local Hostname
# Clients will contact this hostname to send their events
# hostname = "openwec.mydomain.local"

# [Required]
# Server listen address
# listen_address = "127.0.0.1"

# [Optional]
# Server listenning port
# If missing in config, default value is 5985
# listen_port = 5985

# [Optional]
# Maximum content size allowed in client messages.
# If missing in config, default value is 512000 (which should be safe)
# max_content_length = 512000

# Authentication settings for this collector
[collectors.authentication]
# [Required]
# Authentication method: Kerberos, Tls
# type = "Kerberos"

## Kerberos configuration

# [Required]
# Service Principal Name of the openwec account
# Should be something like "HTTP/openwec.mydomain.local@MYDOMAIN.LOCAL"
# service_principal_name = ""

# [Required]
# Keytab file that contains secrets of the openwec account.
# It must contain an entry for the principal <kerberos.service_principal_name>.
# It may contains other entries, which won't be used by openwec.
# keytab = "/etc/krb5.keytab"

## End of Kerberos configuration

## TLS configuration

# [Required]
# CA certificate used to sign client certificates
# ca_certificate = "/etc/ca-cert.pem"

# [Required]
# Server certificate
