[server]

# [Optional]
# Set subscriptions refresh interval
# Subscriptions are stored in the database. When you edit them using the cli,
# you only modify the database.
# The server retrieves its subscriptions from the database and cache
# them in memory. The in-memory subscriptions are refreshed at a fixed
# interval: `db_sync_interval`.
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# db_sync_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# Set heartbeat cache flush interval
# Heartbeat messages are cached in memory before being stored in database
# to improve performances.
# A flush operation saves all cached heartbeats in database at a fixed
# interval: `flush_heartbeats_interval`
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# flush_heartbeats_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# To "store" a heartbeat, request handlers send a message to a task responsible
# for managing heartbeats using a queue.
# The database store operation may take some time. During this operation, new heartbeats message
# are not popped from the queue, leading to the queue being full. When the queue is full,
# request handlers have to wait before sending a response to clients.
# You can customize the size of the queue, depending of the expected output of heartbeats
# messages to store and the duration of the database store operation.
# Default size of the queue is 2048.
# heartbeats_queue_size = 2048

# [Optional]
# Set node name
# This may be used by outputs. Unset by default.
# node_name = unset

# [Optional]
# Keytab file path that contains secrets for Kerberos SPNs used by collectors.
# Required if Kerberos authentication is used by at least one collector.
# It must contain entries for service principals used by collectors.

# keytab = "/etc/krb5.keytab"

# [Optional]
# Set the duration to remain idle before sending TCP keepalive probes.
# Defaults to 7200
# tcp_keepalive_time = 7200

# [Optional]
# Set the duration between two successive TCP keepalive retransmissions,
# if acknowledgement to the previous keepalive transmission is not received.
# Defaults to None (i.e. system value)
# tcp_keepalive_intvl = None

# [Optional]
# Set the number of retransmissions to be carried out before declaring
# that remote end is not available.
# Defaults to None (i.e. system value)

# [Optional]
# Access log formatting pattern
# Pattern syntax is explained here: https://docs.rs/log4rs/latest/log4rs/encode/pattern 
# Contextual information can be accessed using {X(<value>)}. Available values are:
# - http_status
# - http_method
# - http_uri
# - response_time (in ms)
# - ip
# - port
# - principal
# - conn_status: 'X' (connection aborted before the response completed)
#                '+' (connection may be kept alive after the response is sent)

##  Databases settings  ##
##########################

# Two database backends are currently supported: SQLite and Postgres.
# Note that Postgres implementation is made to work well with CockroachDB.

## SQLite configuration

# SQLite DB path
# The SQLite DB will be created and initialised if it does not already exist.
# path = "/var/db/openwec/openwec.sqlite"

## End of SQLite

## Postgres configuration

# [Required]
# Postgres database Hostname
# host = "localhost"

# [Required]
# Postgres database port
# port = 5432 

# [Required]
# Postgres database name. It must already exist and user <postgres.user> should
# have all permissions on it.

# - Disable: Do not use TLS
# - Prefer: Attempt to connect with TLS but allow sessions without
# - Require: Require the use of TLS
# ssl_mode = "Prefer"

# [Optional]

# When ssl_mode is Prefer or Require, you may want to use a specific CA
# certificate file instead of the ones trusted by your system (default).

###########################
##  Collectors settings  ##
###########################

# You may define multiple collect servers.
# Each collector must listen on a different (address, port) pair.
# All collectors share the same database.
# This is useful if you want to support both Kerberos and TLS authentication

# This defines one collector
[[collectors]]
# [Required]
# Local Hostname
# Clients will contact this hostname to send their events

# If missing in config, default value is 512000 (which should be safe)
# max_content_length = 512000

# [Optional]
# Enable proxy protocol 
# This feature allows openwec to be used behind a layer 4 load balancer
# whilst the proxy protocol is enabled to preserve the client IP address and port.
# If enabled, openwec EXPECTS a proxy protocol header (v1 or v2) to be present
# and will close the connection otherwise.
# See The PROXY protocol spec for more details: <https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt>.
# enable_proxy_protocol = false

# [Optional]
# openwec will pretend to listen on this port instead of the "real" one
# configured in `listen_port`.
# This can be useful if openwec is behind a load balancer.
# If unset, the default value is `listen_port`.

# Authentication settings for this collector

# [Required]
# Authentication method: Kerberos, Tls

# [server.keytab] is required when using Kerberos authentication
