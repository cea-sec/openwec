[server]

# [Optional]
# Set subscriptions refresh interval
# Subscriptions are stored in the database. When you edit them using the cli,
# you only modify the database.
# The server retrieves its subscriptions from the database and cache
# them in memory. The in-memory subscriptions are refreshed at a fixed
# interval: `db_sync_interval`.
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# db_sync_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# Set heartbeat cache flush interval
# Heartbeat messages are cached in memory before being stored in database
# to improve performances.
# A flush operation saves all cached heartbeats in database at a fixed
# interval: `flush_heartbeats_interval`
# Default value is 5 seconds.
# flush_heartbeats_interval = 5

# [Optional]
# To "store" a heartbeat, request handlers send a message to a task responsible
# for managing heartbeats using a queue.
# The database store operation may take some time. During this operation, new heartbeats message
# are not popped from the queue, leading to the queue being full. When the queue is full,
# request handlers have to wait before sending a response to clients.
# You can customize the size of the queue, depending of the expected output of heartbeats
# messages to store and the duration of the database store operation.
# Default size of the queue is 2048.
# heartbeats_queue_size = 2048

# [Optional]
# Set node name
# This may be used by outputs. Unset by default.
# node_name = unsef

# [Optional]
# Keytab file path that contains secrets for Kerberos SPNs used by collectors.
# Required if Kerberos authentication is used by at least one collector.
# It must contain entries for service principals used by collectors.
# It can contain other entries that aren't used by openwec.
# keytab = "/etc/krb5.keytab"

# [Optional]
# Set the duration to remain idle before sending TCP keepalive probes.
# Defaults to 7200
# tcp_keepalive_time = 7200

# [Optional]
# Set the duration between two successive TCP keepalive retransmissions,
# if acknowledgement to the previous keepalive transmission is not received.
# Defaults to None (i.e. system value)
# tcp_keepalive_intvl = None

# [Optional]
# Set the number of retransmissions to be carried out before declaring
# that remote end is not available.
# Defaults to None (i.e. system value)
# tcp_keepalive_probes = None

##   Logging settings   ##

# This parameter is overwritten by --verbosity argument.
# Default value is warn 
# Possible values are: error, warn, info, debug, trace
# verbosity = "warn"

# [Optional]
# Server logs destination, can be :
# - stdin
# - stderr
# - <path>: logs will be stored in the given file
# Default value is stderr
# server_logs = stderr

# [Optional]
# Server log formatting pattern
# Pattern syntax is explained here: https://docs.rs/log4rs/latest/log4rs/encode/pattern 
# Default value is None, meaning "{d} {l} {t} - {m}{n}"
# server_logs_pattern = None

# [Optional]
# Access logs destination, can be :
# - stdin
# - stderr
# - <path>: logs will be stored in the given file
# - None: disable access logs
# Default value is None
# access_logs = None

# [Optional]
# Access log formatting pattern
# Pattern syntax is explained here: https://docs.rs/log4rs/latest/log4rs/encode/pattern 
# Contextual information can be accessed using {X(<value>)}. Available values are:
# - http_status
# - http_method
# - http_uri
# - response_time (in ms)
# - ip
# - port
# - principal
# Default value is None, meaning "{X(ip)}:{X(port)} - {X(principal)} [{d}] \"{X(http_uri)}\" {X(http_status)} {X(response_time)}{n}"

##  Databases settings  ##

# Two database backends are currently supported: SQLite and Postgres.
# Note that Postgres implementation is made to work well with CockroachDB.

# The SQLite DB will be created and initialised if it does not already exist.
# path = "/var/db/openwec/openwec.sqlite"

## End of SQLite

## Postgres configuration

# [Required]
# Postgres database Hostname
# host = "localhost"

# When ssl_mode is Prefer or Require, you may want to use a specific CA
# certificate file instead of the ones trusted by your system (default).

# When performing bulk insert queries, this is the maximum number of
# entries that will be inserted in one query.

###########################
##  Collectors settings  ##
###########################

# You may define multiple collect servers.
# Each collector must listen on a different (address, port) pair.
# All collectors share the same database.
# This is useful if you want to support both Kerberos and TLS authentication

# This defines one collector
[[collectors]]
# [Required]
# Local Hostname
# Clients will contact this hostname to send their events
# hostname = "openwec.mydomain.local"

# [Required]
# Server listen address

# [Optional]
# Server listenning port
# If missing in config, default value is 5985
# listen_port = 5985

# [Optional]
# Maximum content size allowed in client messages.
# If missing in config, default value is 512000 (which should be safe)
# max_content_length = 512000

# Authentication settings for this collector

# [Required]
# Authentication method: Kerberos, Tls
#Â type = "Kerberos"

## Kerberos configuration

# [server.keytab] is required when using Kerberos authentication

# [Required]
# Service Principal Name of the openwec account
# Should be something like "HTTP/openwec.mydomain.local@MYDOMAIN.LOCAL"
# service_principal_name = ""

## End of Kerberos configuration
